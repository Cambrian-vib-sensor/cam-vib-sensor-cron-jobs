1. Write the command in a batch file with full path for all the files.
   Example: "C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" "C:\CambrianBackendProcessing\index.js"  >> "C:\CambrianBackendProcessing\backup_log.txt"
   
2. Create a task/basic task. Write the batchfile with full path in the Program/Script field. Add args or Start in are not required.
   Note: 1. Directly writing "C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" in the program field, and "C:\CambrianBackendProcessing\index.js"  >> "C:\CambrianBackendProcessing\backup_log.txt" in the Add args field did not work.
         2. Writing C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe in the program field, and 
		   /c "C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" "C:\CambrianBackendProcessing\index.js"  >> "C:\CambrianBackendProcessing\backup_log.txt" in the Add args field did not work either.
		 3. Writing C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe in the program field, and 
		   /c "C:\CambrianBackendProcessing\command_line.bat" in the works. (NOTE: /c is needed to run commands with cmd).
		   
3. a. Set Account to user (Samsad), Run whether or not user logged on and give password.
   b. Set the schedule as On schedule, One time, 5 min run indefinitely (This solves the task scheduler not running issue).

   c. Tick Wake the computer to run this task under Power in Conditions tab
	 
Regarding the use of process in the program to access the process' environment:	 
4. If the program (eg. index.js) accesses data from the process eg. environment variables from the process, then sometimes running from outside may give an error.
   For eg: process.cwd() will give a different current working directory where the process is running; if it is used to specify the path of a file, the file could not be found.
   In this case, hardcode the location of the file rather than using process.cwd().
5. VS Code uses .env file that allows us to store env variables in the .env file that shall be automatically set to the environment by the VS application.
   When the program is run outside VS, the variables are not set and could not be accessed using process.env; COPY the values to constants inside the program.
   
Regarding wake-up when computer sleeps:
6. Control Panel -> Hardware and sound -> Power Options -> Change Plan Settings -> Change advanced power settings -> Allow wake timers -> On battery: Enable, Plugged in: Enable
7. Control Panel -> Hardware and sound -> Power Options -> Choose what the power button does -> choose Hibernate on all dropdowns.
8. Make sure #3.c. is done.
